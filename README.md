# TFBD decoder in Rust

This is a Rust CLI program to decode template files (`.t`) produced by The Flaming
Bird Disassembler for the Apple IIGS. The primary decoder,
[tfbd.py](https://github.com/ursetto/a2composer/blob/master/midi-magic/tfbd.py),
is written in Python. This one is just an excuse to experiment with
Rust.
